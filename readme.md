# Fake News Detection Application

This is a simple web application built using Streamlit that detects whether a news article is fake or real based on its title and content. The application utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning model trained by me for classification. The code of the model is given in the .ipynb file.
