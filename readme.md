I have created a fake news detection model in this project.
It is an end to end NLP project.
First I have created an ipynb file where I am preprocessing the data and then training the model using logistic regression.
Then I have stored the model and vectorizer in pkl files and made app.py using streamlit .
On this website, you can enter a news article title and/or it's content and the model will try to accurately predict whether the news article is fake or not.
